        One of the key HTML elements we use to build a webpage is the <em>body</em> element.
        Only content inside the opening and closing body tags can be displayed to the screen.
        Here's what opening and closing body tags look like:
    <pre>
            &ltbody&gt
        </pre>
    <pre>
            &ltbody&gt
        </pre>
    Once the file has a body, many different types of content - including text, images, and buttons - can be added to
    the body.
    <pre>
            &ltbody&gt
                &ltp&gt This is content in the body &ltp&gt
            &ltbody&gt
        </pre>
    </p>

        HTML is composed of <strong>elements</strong>. These elemens structure the webpage and define its content. Let's
        take a look at how they're written.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following image displays an HTML paragraph element:
        <img src="images/diagrama.png" alt="Picture representing the elements of a tag">
    </p>
    <p>As we can see, the paragraph element is made up of:
    <ul>
        <li>An opening tag (&ltp&gt)</li>
        <li>The content("Hello world!" text)</li>
        <li>A closing tag (&ltp&gt)</li>
    </ul>
    A <strong>tag</strong> and the <strong>content</strong> between is called a html <strong>element</strong>. There are
    many tags that we can use to organize and display text and other types of content, like images.

        <strong>HTML</strong> provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, text or videos. HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>A <em>markup language</em> is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text</li>
            <li>In HTML, the computer can interpret <em>raw text</em> that is wrapped in html elements</li>
            <li><em>HyperText</em> is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as <em>hyperlinks</em></li>
        </ul>
